Hi there. Lucas here. I started a blog. That's obvious, though. What will I blog about? WHY?

Fair questions. I don't know if anyone else will read these, and I am not going to build a _presence_ with this either, so I'm motivated to [learn in public](https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public). Kind of simple. Taking notes on topics I'm learning about, and creating a reference for when I forget a few months later. I might write a few posts about my background and particular perspective as a second-career dev, too, but the content will primarily be technical.

I look forward to having some fun with this, and I sincerely do not apologize for future dad jokes and weird gifs.
