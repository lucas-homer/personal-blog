# excerpt: "Stubbing out some plans for a blog."
---

I deployed the new version of my site yesterday! I've wanted to do this for a while, but for whatever reason, the time is now. I want to "learn in public," generally speaking, but exactly how I set up the blog for that, and what topics to add to my list, has been a question I am continually considering.

I've slept on it, and gnawed on it some more. I read a bunch of stuff about [digital gardens](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden). There are even [themes](https://github.com/johno/digital-garden). I'm down with all of that. Maybe I'll create a wiki so I can find articles by topic rather than chronological order. Eventually I'll add search, too, but for now, the entire mission is consistency 📓.

## Some History

### 🎺 -- ⚖️ -- 💻

The short version is this: I went to college to study music, then a few years in I decided to go to law school after finishing college. I did all the work and took out all the loans and passed the bar and became a lawyer. And not a half bad one, either. However, I wasn't happy. I was not excited about my future.

After a few musician buddies became developers, I started to get interested. A bootcamp and 20 months of dev work experience later, here I am.

There is more to say on the transition from law to software. Struggles and advantages to going from lawyer to coder. Similarities and differences, too. I am already writing about this topic, so hopefully more on it soon. I love hearing about others who are second-career devs (or third!). Everyone has such interesting stories to tell, and most bring really valuable skills that you don't get from the standard CS degree program.

### 🌾 -- 🌴

Five months ago, my girlfriend, our dog, and I moved west to Los Angeles from Kansas City, MO. I work full-time remote for SelectQuote, on the same team I was on when I worked and lived in KC.

So far the switch has worked out pretty well. I spent a little bit of money so I could have a nice home setup, and the natural light is amazing. Definitely beats the fluorescent light and glass walls fishbowl vibe from the old digs.

Working remotely can have its drawbacks too. I can get super focused like I rarely could in the office, which is great, but sometimes communication can be a challenge. I imagine teams that are primarily distributed handle this a bit better than mine, as I am in the minority. I think as a result sometimes I am not quite as in sync with project managers or lead devs.

At the end of the day, though, I'm proud of the work I've done after moving out here. I have 20 months of professional developer experience, which is not nothing, but it's not a lot either. My bosses trusted and believed in me to do great work with a little less supervision. It hasn't always been easy, but I have been able to debug and work through complicated problems on my own, without the crutch of the lead dev one desk away. As a result, I'm a little more confident in my ability to "figure it out."

I'm sure I'll start to form more meaningful observations and opinions about navigating remote work, but one quick shout out to the amazingness of VS Code Live Share and video chat. I can pair program remotely and fix bugs in prod with the rest of them 😱😰🤔😎.
